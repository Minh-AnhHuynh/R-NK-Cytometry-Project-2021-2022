# R NK Cytometry Project 2021-2022

## Initial setup :
* Open the "R-NK-Cytometry-Project-2021-2022.rproj" file in RStudio.
* Scripts do not have a `setwd()` because R projects allow the directories to be relative.
* However directory inside the main folder (called "R-NK-Cytometry-Project-2021-2022") must be exactly as displayed for pulling data files as needed and saving results in correct folders.
