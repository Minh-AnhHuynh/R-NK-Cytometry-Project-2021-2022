# R NK Cytometry Project 2021-2022

## Initial setup :
* Open the "R-NK-Cytometry-Project-2021-2022.rproj" file in RStudio to start session which sets the working directory to relative to ".\R-NK-Cytometry-Project-2021-2022"
  * Notes : Scripts do not have a `setwd()` because R projects allow the directories to be relative. However directory inside the main folder must be exactly as displayed for pulling data files as needed and saving results in correct folders.
* Installing **librarian** package is necessary with `install.packages("librarian")`. Librarian will then handle all other related packages appropriately, by installing them if you're missing them and/or by loading them if already installed.
* The scripts contain a detailed outline that is best navigated thanks to RStudio.
